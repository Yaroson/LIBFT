# Libft
A project about creating a library containing 44 coded functions that can be useful anywhere, anytime!


This project covers the use of all the basic variable types and also the manipulation of the linked lists.

Working with malloc and free, some functions allow to allocate and use the heap memory.

The Makefile is used to easily compile and create the library, as well as to clean up afterwards.

The subject can be found in the "en.subject.pdf" file.
