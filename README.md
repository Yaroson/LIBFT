# Libft
A s19 coding school project to create a personal library.

Consists in writing 44 different functions which are useful everywhere, all the time.


Some of the functions are the recoded/improved versions of the existing functions such as memcpy, strchr, calloc etc.


This project covers advanced manipulations of all the basic types of variables and pointers and also covers juggling with linked lists.


The Makefile is used to easily manipulate the library.
